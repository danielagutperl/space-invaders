# The best bits
My favourite thing was thinking about the game logic, and moving so many elements across the screen. I hadn't done that so much before (just in a Pong dupe, but that worked differently and used SVGs instead). In particular the alien movement in a group was challenging, and having aliens ‘know’ their particular position, status (dead or live), and their shooting was fun to get my head around!

# What I'd change
Sprites, look and feel of the game. It doesn't look as good as I would like. I care about that, and I'd like to put time into making it look good!
