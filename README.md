# Space Invaders
This is a dupe of the awesome 1970's space invaders game ([https://spaceinvaders.square-enix-games.com/]).

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game from the 80s. The player aims to shoot an invading alien armada, before it reaches the planet's surface using a mounted gun turret.

The player can only move left or right. The aliens also move from left to right, and also down each time the reach the side of the screen. The aliens also periodically drop bombs towards the player.

## To play:
Move left: Key left-arrow 

Move right: Key right-arrow 

Shoot: Key up-arrow 


## Requirements
* The player should be able to clear at least one wave of aliens
* The player's score should be displayed
* The main challenge here is the movement of large groups of aliens in formation, and the animation of the bombs and player's shots. There are several approaches here, with collision detection being the more challenging.

| ~ 3.5 days        | Game logic, minimal styling    |

## The best bits
My favourite thing was thinking about the game logic, and moving so many elements across the screen. I hadn't done that so much before (just in a Pong dupe, but that worked differently and used SVGs instead). In particular the alien movement in a group was challenging, and having aliens ‘know’ their particular position, status (dead or live), and their shooting was fun to get my head around!

## What I'd change
Sprites, look and feel of the game. It doesn't look as good as I would like. I care about that, and I'd like to put time into making it look good!
